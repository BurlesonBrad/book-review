# WordPress Book Review Plugin #

The WordPress Book Review plugin saves you time when writing your book review posts – no more copying and pasting or manually entering in a book’s details. Instead, you can focus on the important stuff, like actually writing your reviews!

The plugin can also help to increase traffic to your site by creating better-looking search results in Google that will make yours stand out from the rest.

And, if you’re interested in throwing monetization into the mix, the WordPress Book Review plugin makes that easy too!
